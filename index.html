        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>A table of <a href='http://kiva.com/'>Kiva's</a> field partners (the microfinance organizations which administer loans made possible by Kiva) which may be sorted and filtered.
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Many of Kiva's field partners collect interest on the loans they disburse. The rates of interest vary, but they are sometimes very high despite the fact that much of the risk and principal cost is offloaded to Kiva's generous users. Identifying field partners with high (or low) interest would be easiest if they could all be sorted by their "<a href='http://www.kiva.org/help/borrowingCostComparison#AveragePartnerPortfolioYield'>Portfolio Yield</a>" (average interest rates) and "<a href='http://www.kiva.org/help/borrowingCostComparison#AveragePartnerReturnOnAssets'>Profitability</a>" (return on assets) metrics. The higher those rates, the higher the interest will tend to be on loans from those lenders. The ability to so sort the list of Kiva's field partners is one of the main motivating forces behind the creation of KivaSort.
        <p>Kiva provides a table of field partners on their web site, but it has limited sorting options (it cannot be sorted by portfolio yield, for example). Kiva does provide <a href='http://build.kiva.org/'>nice APIs</a> for their various services, which KivaSort uses. Another third-party website called <a href='http://www.kivalens.org/'>KivaLens.org</a> exists for filtering field partners. However, until very recently (July 2015) it required Microsoft's Silverlight plugin and did not run on many browsers.
        <p>By default, KivaSort lists field partners ordered primarily by "Portfolio Yield" so that field partners with low interest rates will be near the top. But note that expensive loans do not necessarily indicate usurious loans (at least not more usurious than other lenders); some locations have legitimately high costs associated with administering loans due to such factors as social instability, inflation, and lack of infrastructure. In that respect, a high "Profitability" metric may be the best way to identify highly exploitative lenders -- although a consistently negative "Profitability" may indicate a non-sustainable field partner.

            <li><a href='http://kivalens.org/'>KivaLens.org</a> - KivaLens has now been rewritten in JavaScript and runs well in all modern browsers. It is a much more complicated app than KivaSort, geared toward heavy lenders who wish to carefully vet their borrowers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to use KivaSort</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Click column header to sort in ascending order. Click again to sort in descending order.</li>
            <li>Hold down shift and click column headers to sort by multiple columns simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Drag column headers to change their order.</li>
            <li>Columns that are hidden or do not fit on the screen can be displayed as sub-rows by clicking the green icon in the first column.</li>
            <li>Type a [partial] word in the "Search" box to filter the table down to only rows containing the search term in any of their columns.</li>
            <li>Uncheck the "Hide inactive field partners" box to show field partners who are currently inactive or paused.</li>
            <li>Uncheck the "Hide field partners with incomplete data" to show field partners who do not have some data (such as Portfolio Rate). Missing data is displayed as "-" in the table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The buttons across the top can be used to manage the table:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>"Show X rows/page"</dt>
            <dd>Set how many rows to show per page.</dd>

            <dt>"Column Visibility"</dt>
            <dd>Set which columns are visible across the top of the screen. Hide columns to make the table more manageable. The data from hidden columns can still be seen by clicking the green button in each column of the first row. Columns which cannot fit on the screen are automatically hidden. Only visible columns may be used for sorting, so use the "Column Visibility" button to make sure the columns you care about fit at the top of the table.</dd>

            <dt>"Export"</dt>
            <dd>This button allows you to copy the table data to the clipboard or download it as a CSV-formatted file. All columns will be included in the exported data, but rows which have been filtered out will not be included. This button also provides the option to "View source JSON" which will open a new window/tab containing the cleaned-up data sent by the Kiva web service.</dd>

            <dt>"Reload"</dt>
            <dd>This button will re-fetch the most current data from Kiva and refresh the table's contents with it.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>The KivaSort.org web site is completely open source. If you'd like to view or contribute to the project, please take a look at the public git repository: <a href='https://github.com/cristoper/kivasort.org'>https://github.com/cristoper/kivasort.org</a>
        <p>The JavaScript which runs KivaSort depends on two open-source JQuery plugins:
        <ul>
            <li><a href='https://datatables.net/'>DataTables</a> - the impressive plugin which does all of the heavy lifting here.</li>
            <li><a href='https://github.com/cristoper/jquery-KivaSort/'>jquery-KivaSort</a> - the plugin which fetches data from the Kiva API and wraps it in a DataTable. This plugin may be used independently to easily embed KivaSort tables in any HTML document.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>KivaSort.org and the KivaSort JQuery plugin were created and are maintained by <a href='https://github.com/cristoper'>chris burkhardt</a> &lt;<a href='mailto:chris@mretc.net'>chris@mretc.net</a>&gt;.

            <h3>Kiva</h3>
            <p>Instead of a direct money gift, you might also consider funding a Kiva gift card which I can use to lend to borrowers through field partners of my choosing:
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href='http://www.kiva.org/gifts/kiva-cards#/lender'>Kiva Card Page</a></li>
                <li>Enter my Kiva Lender ID in the form: <code>chris21995723</code></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Labour</h3>
            <p>KivaSort is an open-source project, which depends on larger open-source projects, and we all need bug/typo reports, feature requests, and code/documentation patches. Please take a look at these projects if you'd like to help out:
            <ul>
                <li><a href='https://github.com/cristoper/kivasort.org'>KivaSort.org</a> - this website.</li>
                <li><a href='https://github.com/cristoper/jquery-KivaSort/'>JQuery-KivaSort</a> - a JQuery plugin which fetches field partner data from Kiva and wraps it in a sortable DataTable.</li>
                <li><a href='http://datatables.net/'>DataTables</a> - the JQuery plugin which does all of the hard work of making HTML tables dynamic.</li>
